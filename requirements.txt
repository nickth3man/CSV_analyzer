# TODO (Dependencies): Create requirements.lock with pinned versions
# Current requirements use minimum versions (>=) or no versions at all.
# This can lead to:
#   - Non-reproducible builds (different versions on different machines)
#   - Breaking changes from upstream updates
#   - Security vulnerabilities from unpinned transitive dependencies
# Recommended approach:
#   1. Use `pip-compile` (from pip-tools) to generate requirements.lock:
#      pip-compile requirements.txt -o requirements.lock
#   2. Or use `uv lock` if using uv package manager (already have uv.lock)
#   3. In CI, install from lock file: pip install -r requirements.lock
#   4. Periodically update with: pip-compile --upgrade

# TODO (Dependencies): Add version constraints for security
# The nba_api package is community-maintained and may have irregular updates.
# Consider:
#   1. Pinning to specific tested versions
#   2. Adding fallback handling if API changes
#   3. Monitoring for security advisories

# TODO (Dependencies): Split into base and optional dependencies
# Consider splitting into:
#   - requirements.txt (core): pocketflow, openai, pandas
#   - requirements-web.txt: chainlit, matplotlib
#   - requirements-nba.txt: nba_api, requests
# This allows lighter installations for specific use cases.
